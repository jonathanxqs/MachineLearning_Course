# Final Project 
# Real Estate Zestimate Prediction 
./Zillow/ is our Machine Learning project. We use Linear Regression/LASSO in XGBOOST to predict logerror between Zestimate and real sale price.

## First Step: Data CollectionÂ 

At the beginning of our project, we need to find a huge property data Source and the data also need some attibutes, which can support us to do more fancy test in Machine Learning. Because a small data set always cases data overfit. Fortunately, we found 2 million rows dat of PM2.5 in Harvard CGA website. Now let's us to do the project ! 

Because of GitHub file size's limit is 100MB and property.csv is more than 500 MB, you can find the original data source here:
```sh

```

---------------------------
## Second Step: Data Extraction and Clean
After we get the data. First, we decide to only use One hundred thousand data, Because it's need long time to process two million data.

Second, we find there are lots of invalid rows, which have '-' or NaN. Before we do Machine Learning, we need to clean the data. So we write a data clean function to help us clean and standardize data.

Now we can get all the valid data set, it has 93790 rows, 1 column output,and 10 column attributes.

Finally, we want to make more attributes.So what we have done is to add 2-order and 3-order attributes to our data set. now it have 30 attributes.
